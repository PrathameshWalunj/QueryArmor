# QueryArmor™

QueryArmor™ is an advanced defensive tool designed to protect web applications against SQL injection and XSS attacks. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and pattern recognition, QueryArmor™ aims to significantly enhance the security posture of web applications.

## Features

- Machine learning-based pattern recognition for identifying potentially malicious SQL and XSS payloads
- Advanced input sanitization techniques
- Adaptive learning capabilities to stay ahead of emerging threats
- Customizable rule sets for different application contexts
- Command-line interface for easy integration into development workflows
- Comprehensive testing suite for ongoing vulnerability assessment


## How It Works

QueryArmor™ uses a unique and highly advanced approach to protect against SQL injection and XSS attacks:

1. Custom Payload Generation: We utilize a vast array of specialized Python functions to generate and modify a diverse set of potential attack payloads. This includes hundreds of custom functions that create variations of known attack patterns.

2. Advanced Pattern Recognition: Our sophisticated machine learning algorithm is trained on this extensive, custom-generated dataset. This approach allows QueryArmor™ to recognize not just known attacks, but also subtle variations and potentially new attack vectors.

3. Adaptive Learning: The system continuously updates its knowledge base, incorporating new patterns and attack techniques as they emerge in the cybersecurity landscape.

4. Intelligent Sanitization: Based on the insights from our machine learning model, QueryArmor™ applies context-aware input sanitization, providing robust protection against both known and emerging threats.

This unique combination of custom payload generation, advanced machine learning, and adaptive techniques positions QueryArmor™ at the forefront of web application security.
